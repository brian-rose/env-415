Is this cooling effect different if the cloud is low or high? Explain.\n",

You will create a model that has both *pressure* and *latitude* as coordinates. This model will have no horizontal heat transport. It is essentially just a collection of single column models, one for each latitude band. Each column doesn't really know anything about the state of its neighbors.\n",

You will probably find it convenient to use the same latitude points as the ozone data.\n",
