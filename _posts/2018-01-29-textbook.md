Because of the mix-up with the textbook order, I have scanned Chapter 1 of the Climate Modelling Primer (our textbook) so you can get started on the reading. There is a link on the [handouts page]({{site.baseurl}}/handouts).

This is password-protected as it is intended only for students registered for this course. I will send out the password information by email.
