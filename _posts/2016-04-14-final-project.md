For the last assignment of the semester, everyone will choose their own topic. This is an opportunity to use a model to investigate something you find particularly interesting. You can extend questions we have looked at in past homework and lectures, or do something entirely new. Feel free to discuss your ideas with me, in person or over email.

You will submit a very brief **project proposal**, due on **Thursday April 21**. No more than one paragraph please. I just want to know what question you will investigate, and what tool you will use.

The completed project will be **due on the last day of class, Tuesday May 3**.

These dates are also listed on the [class schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule).
