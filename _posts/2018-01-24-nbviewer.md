On the [handouts page]({{site.baseurl}}/handouts) you will now find two different links for each Jupyter notebook.

One links to the notebook itself -- the `*.ipynb` file. Right-click on these links to download the notebooks to your computer.

The other link is to a service called `nbviewer` which just renders the notebook as a regular web page. You may find this convenient for viewing the content without bothering to launch a notebook server. But note that these are static web pages without the interactive Python interpreter.
